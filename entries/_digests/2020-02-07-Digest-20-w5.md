### [Reflecting of my failure to build a billion dollar company, by Sahil Lavingia](https://marker.medium.com/reflecting-on-my-failure-to-build-a-billion-dollar-company-b0c31d7db0e7)

The founder of Gumroad [@shl](https://twitter.com/shl) tells the story of how he built his company first as venture-backed startup failing to achieve expected growth and transitioning back to a solo company. @shl: "It doesn’t matter how amazing your product is, or how fast you ship features. The market you’re in will determine most of your growth."

### [Why software engineering processes and tools don’t work for machine learning, by Gideon Mendels](https://link.medium.com/Bn3v3bdbO3)

Interesting reading from Comet.ai about what it means to experimentate when doing Machine Learning. Don't agree with everything though. Tasks can be indeed broken down even though not as much as with "traditional" software development. I like the discussion on how proper tooling has such an impact in iteration cycles

### [Joe Rogan Experience - Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIcQwDkcaWk)

[@lexfridman](https://twitter.com/lexfridman) runs one the most interesting podcast on the internet (The Artificial Intelligence Podcast). Some of the interesting take aways from him:
* Fasting. He usually do fasting for periods of 24-48 hours. He has noted a spike in focus and having more energy (I actually have felt the same). On the other hand, he percieved himself to be more annoyed at people when they "are full of shit" and call them out.
* Hard work. Lex is a believer that hard-work is that allows progress. He seem to center all his life choices around that.

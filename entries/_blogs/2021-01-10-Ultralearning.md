I recently read [Ultralearning - Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate your Career](https://www.amazon.com/Ultralearning-Master-Outsmart-Competition-Accelerate/dp/006285268X) by [Scott H. Young](https://twitter.com/ScottHYoung). In this book, he exposes a set of 9 principles that underlie ultralearning projects. Ultralearning is the process of intense and self-directed learning and practice to acquire or improve a skill. A ultralearning project can last from 1 month to a year, depending on the nature. 

It is an easy to read and interesting book. I think it does not says something really new but I think it does a great work at summarizing and digesting a lot of literature in learning. To remember future me, I am leaving here some of the most interesting bullets.

# Metalearning (First, draw a map)

Start by learning how to learn applied to the topic. It is worth it to expend around 10% of the time researching and planning about the topic.
* Have I done research into what are the typical ways of learning this subject or skill?
* Have I interviewed successful learners to see what resources and advice they can recommend?
* Have I spent about 10 percent of total time on preparing my project plan?

# Focus (Sharpen your knife)
Reserve an appropriate amount of time so you can focus on the learning process. Don’t procrastinate and dedicate quality time. Be either “fully focused or strategically disengaged“
* Am I focused when I spend time learning, or am I multitasking and distracted?
* Am I skipping learning sessions or procrastinating?
* When I start a session, how long does it take before I’m in a good flow?
* How long can I sustain that focus before my mind starts to wander?
* How sharp is my attention?
* Should it be more concentrated for intensity or more diffuse for creativity?

# Directness (Go straight ahead)
Learn by doing the thing that you want to become good at. Don’t trade it off for other tasks, just because those are more convenient or comfortable.
* Am I learning the skill in the way I’ll eventually be using it?
* If not, what mental processes are missing from my practice that exist in the real environment?
* How can I practice transferring the knowledge I learn from my book/class/video to real life?

# Drill (Attack your weakest point)
Be ruthless in improving your weakest point. Break down the skill to be learnt in smaller sub-skills and practice those that seem more difficult independently. Then, practice all together.
* Am I spending time focusing on the weakest points of my performance?
* What is the rate-limiting step that is holding me back?
* Does it feel as though my learning is slowing down and that there’s too many components of the skill to master?
* If so, how can I split apart a complex skill to work on smaller, more manageable components of it?

# Retrieval (Test to learn)
Test yourself before you feel confident and push yourself to actively recall information rather than passively review it.
* Am I spending most of my time reading and reviewing, or am I solving problems and recalling things from memory without looking at my notes?
* Do I have some way of testing myself, or do I just assume I’ll remember?
* Can I successfully explain what I learned yesterday, last week, a year ago?
* How do I know if I can?

# Feedback (Don’t dodge the punches)
Don’t let your ego get in the way. Feedback can be uncomfortable but it is a key element in learning. Reflect on the received feedback and separate the signal from the noise.
* Am I getting honest feedback about my performance early on, or am I trying to dodge the punches and avoid criticism?
* Do I know what I’m learning well and what I’m not? 
* Am I using feedback correctly, or am I overreacting to noisy data?

# Retention (Don’t fill a leaky bucket)
Understand what you forget and why. Spaced-Repetition System (learn through a long period of time) and overlearning helps retention. Many times you are not able to retain the information because you don’t fundamentally understand it. 
* Do I have a plan in place to remember what I’m learning long term?
* Am I spacing my exposure to information so it will stick longer?
* Am I turning factual knowledge into procedures that I’ll retain?
* Am I overlearning the most critical aspects of the skill?

# Intuition (Dig Deep before building up)
Intuition is developed through play and exploration. Understand the fundamentals and you won’t have to memorize things.
* Do I deeply understand the things I’m learning, or am I just memorizing?
* Could I teach the ideas and procedures I’m studying to someone else (Feynman’ method)?
* Is it clear to me why what I’m learning is true, or does it all seem arbitrary and unrelated?

# Experimentation (Explore outside your comfort zone)
True mastery does not come from following others’ people path but from exploring what other have not yet imagined.
* Am I getting stuck with my current resources and techniques? 
* Do I need to branch out and try new approaches to reach my goal?
* How can I go beyond mastering the basics and create a unique style to solve problems creatively and do things others haven’t explored before?

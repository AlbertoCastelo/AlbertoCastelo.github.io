In this project, I was curious to compare interesting approaches in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision:
* Use a pretrained ResNet model and stack a final Gaussian Process layer to provide the uncertainty estimation. This model was build on top of [GPytorch](https://gpytorch.ai/).
* Consider a Convolutional Bayesian Neural Network and train it from zero using Bayes-to-backprop method. This model builds on top of this [repository](https://github.com/kumar-shridhar/PyTorch-BayesianCNN)

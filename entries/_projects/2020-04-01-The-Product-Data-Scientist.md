It's been more than two years since I started building Data Science based products. 

Throught this period I missed having information about how companies and teams build this kind of products. 

It makes sense as the industry is still trying to figure it out. 

As it is an ongoing process, I created a web to list resources in this area: [The Product Data Scientist](https://theproductdatascientist.com/).
I curate the list manually as I encounter new materials that I think are worth sharing. You can subscribe in the link.


The vision is to build a community of like-minded individuals to share information around this awesome topic.
